# Centralized-System-for-maintenance-of-verified-documents-through-Unique-ID-Generation
Government paperwork can be a headache, especially when you need multiple documents for different purposes. Our research introduces a solution: a user-friendly system that centralizes all your government documents using a unique ID. Upon logging into our portal, a unique ID is generated for each person, ensuring secure access and personalized document management. Through an online portal built with Java and leveraging cloud computing for secure document storage, users can effortlessly upload, access, and edit their documents, eliminating the need for multiple physical visits to government offices. This system not only simplifies document management but also provides a safety net for lost documents by linking them to the unique ID. However, challenges such as data security and privacy concerns must be addressed. Our study investigates how this innovative approach can improve document accessibility and streamline bureaucratic processes for individuals while considering potential drawbacks and solutions.
